# Multiplication Table Generator

## Overview
The Multiplication Table Generator is a Bash script designed to help users generate multiplication tables for a given number. This script allows users to input a number and choose whether they want to see a full multiplication table (from 1 to 10) or a partial table within a specified range. The project aims to provide a simple yet effective tool for practicing loops, handling user input, and applying conditional logic in Bash scripting.

## Project Structure
The project consists of a Bash script file named multiplication_table_generator.sh.

## Features
- User Input for Number: The script prompts the user to enter a number for which the multiplication table will be generated.

- Choice of Table Range: Users can choose between a full multiplication table (1 to 10) or a partial table. If they opt for a partial table, they can specify the start and end of the range.

- Use of Loops: The script implements logic to generate the multiplication table using loops.

- Conditional Logic: It utilizes if-else statements to handle the logic based on the user's choices (full vs. partial table and valid range input).

- Input Validation: The script ensures that users enter valid numbers for the multiplication table and the specified range. It provides feedback for invalid inputs and defaults to a full table if the range is incorrect.

- Readable Output: The multiplication table is displayed in a clear and readable format, adhering to the user's choice of range.

- Comments and Code Quality: The script is well-commented, explaining the purpose of different sections and any important variables or logic used. The code is neatly formatted for easy readability.

## Script Flow
- User Input: The script prompts the user to enter a number for the multiplication table.

- Table Range Selection: It asks if the user wants a full table or a partial table. If partial, it prompts for the start and end numbers of the range.

- Input Validation: The script validates the range inputs and handles invalid or out-of-bound entries.

- Generate and Display Table: It generates and displays the multiplication table according to the specified range.

- Repeat Option: After generating the table, the script provides the option to generate another table for a different number without restarting the script.
